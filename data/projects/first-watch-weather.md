## Overview

First Watch Weather is a modern, responsive web application that uses **OpenWeather's API** and **Google Map Places API** to gather weather data and **Geocodio's API** to render weather conditions based on the user's desired location.

## Key Features

- **Location-Based Weather**: Get weather information for your current location
- **Search Functionality**: Look up weather for any city or location worldwide
- **Detailed Forecasts**: View current conditions and multi-day forecasts
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize weather patterns on an interactive map
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Details

### Frontend Technologies
- **React**: Core framework for building the UI
- **NextJS**: For server-side rendering and improved performance
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and clean styling
- **Axios**: For API requests

### APIs Integrated
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides comprehensive weather data
- **Geocodio API**: Handles geocoding for location-based features
- **Google Maps Places API**: Enhances location search functionality

## Development Challenges

Building First Watch Weather presented several interesting challenges:

1. **API Integration**: Coordinating multiple APIs to work together seamlessly
2. **State Management**: Handling complex state across the application
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring fast load times despite data-heavy operations
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully managing API failures and edge cases
5. **Responsive Design**: Creating an interface that works well on all device sizes

## Future Enhancements

I'm planning to expand the application with:

- **Weather Alerts**: Push notifications for severe weather
- **Historical Data**: Access to past weather patterns
- **Customizable Dashboard**: User preferences for displayed information
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality when internet connection is limited
- **Dark Mode**: Alternative color scheme for night use
