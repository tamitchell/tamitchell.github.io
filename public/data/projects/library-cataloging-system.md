- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication

## Development Process

The development followed an iterative approach:

1. Initial requirements gathering with librarians
2. Database schema design for MARC compatibility
3. API development for core functionality
4. Frontend implementation with focus on usability
5. Testing with real library data
6. Deployment and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

- Barcode scanning integration
- Mobile app for on-the-go cataloging
- Integration with popular library management systems
