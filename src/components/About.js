    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Web Developer with a passion for bringing words from mere paper and
      concepts into a visual reality thatâ€™s both thought-provoking and
      interactive. When I transitioned from learning human languages as a
      linguist to computer programming, I was able to quickly transfer my skill
      of breaking down concepts to their bare syntax and grammar and
      reconstructing them into readable and functional code. 
      </p>
      
      <p>I love the process
      of learning something new, and I love that experience of feeling the drive
      to get better at what I am learning by any means possible. All of these
      qualities not only add up to making me a great programmer, but overall,
      someone highly skilled in the talent of both crafting and materializing
      human narratives that reach vast variety of people, cultures, and
      organizations.
